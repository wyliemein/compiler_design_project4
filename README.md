# Diamondback

![A diamondback](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Crotalus_ruber_02.jpg)

-------

In this assignment, you'll implement a compiler for a small language with
functions declarations and function calls, conforming to the C stack layout.
You'll also add some static well-formedness checks to the compiler.

This is the best I could do:

- **D**ouble-word
- **I**ntel **A**rchitecture
- **MO**stly dynamic
- **N**ested-expression
- (**D**iamondback supports recursion)
- **B**oolean-tagged
- **A**NF-transformed
- **C**ompiler,
- o**K**?

## The Diamondback Language

As usual, we have concrete and abstract syntaxes, along with a specification of
semantics.

### Concrete Syntax

The major addition to Diamondback are _function declarations_. Our programs are
now a sequence of zero or more function declarations, followed by a single _main
expression_.

```
<program> :=
  | <decls> <expr>
  | <expr>

<decls> :=
  | <decl>
  | <decl> <decls>

<decl> :=
  | def <identifier>(<ids>): <expr>
  | def <identifier>(): <expr>

<ids> :=
  | <identifier>
  | <identifier> , <ids>

<expr> :=
  | let <bindings> in <expr>
  | if <expr>: <expr> else: <expr>
  | <binop-expr>

<binop-expr> :=
  | <identifier>
  | <number>
  | true
  | false
  | add1(<expr>)
  | sub1(<expr>)
  | isnum(<expr>)
  | isbool(<expr>)
  | print(<expr>)
  | <identifier>(<exprs>)
  | <identifier>()
  | <expr> + <expr>
  | <expr> - <expr>
  | <expr> * <expr>
  | <expr> < <expr>
  | <expr> > <expr>
  | <expr> == <expr>
  | ( <expr> )

<exprs> :=
  | <expr>
  | <expr> , <exprs>

<bindings> :=
  | <identifier> = <expr>
  | <identifier> = <expr>, <bindings>
```

The other addition is **function applications** or **function calls**, which are
written `<identifier>(<exprs>)`, for example `f(1, 2, 3)`.

### Abstract Syntax

As usual, we have a user-facing syntax and a compiler-facing syntax.

```haskell
-- lib/Language/Diamondback/Types.hs

-- | A Program is a list of declarations and "main" Expr
data Program a = Prog
  { pDecls :: [Decl a]      -- ^ function declarations
  , pBody  :: !(Expr a)     -- ^ "main" expression
  }

-- | Decl are function definitions
data Decl a = Decl
  { fName  :: !(Bind a)     -- ^ name of function
  , fArgs  :: [Bind a]      -- ^ names of parameters
  , fBody  :: !(Expr a)     -- ^ "body"/returned expression
  , fLabel :: a             -- ^ metadata
  }

-- | Expr are single expressions
data Expr a
  = Number  !Integer                       a  -- ^ integer constant
  | Boolean !Bool                          a  -- ^ boolean constant
  | Id      !Id                            a  -- ^ variable
  | Prim1   !Prim1    !(Expr a)            a  -- ^ unary prim-op
  | Prim2   !Prim2    !(Expr a)  !(Expr a) a  -- ^ binary prim-op
  | If      !(Expr a) !(Expr a)  !(Expr a) a  -- ^ conditional
  | Let     !(Bind a) !(Expr a)  !(Expr a) a  -- ^ let-binder
  | App     !Id       [Expr a]             a  -- ^ function call

-- | `Prim1` are unary operations
data Prim1
  = Add1
  | Sub1
  | Print
  | IsNum
  | IsBool

-- | `Prim2` are binary operations
data Prim2
  = Plus
  | Minus
  | Times
  | Less
  | Greater
  | Equal
```

As before we use `AnfExpr` and `ImmExpr` to describe ANF and immediate
expressions. We use, `AnfDecl` and `AnfProgram` for declarations and programs
that have been converted to ANF.

### Semantics

There are several distinguishing features of `diamondback`

+ **Function Applications** A function application should give the answer we'd
  get if we followed the rules for substituting argument values for parameter
  names. So, for example:

```python
def f(x, y):
  x + y

f(1, 2)
```

Should produce 3.

Your compiler should use the rules for C stacks discussed in class and at [this
assembly guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) to
implement this behavior.

There are a number of **new errors** that can occur now that we have function
declarations and calls. Your implementation should catch all of these cases
**statically**; i.e. _before_ the program runs:

- A function application with the **wrong number of arguments** should signal an
  error containing the string `"arity"`
- A function application of a **non-existent function** should signal an error
  containing the string `"not defined"`
- An identifier **without a corresponding binding location** should report an
  error containing the string `"unbound"`
- A let binding that **redefines a variable already in scope** should report an
  error containing the string `"shadow binding"`
- A function declaration with **duplicate names in the argument list** should
  report an error containing the string `"duplicate parameter"`
- **Multiple function definitions** with the same name, should result in an
  error containing the string `"duplicate function"`
- A **numeric constant is too large** (as discussed in class), should result in
  an error containing the string `"too large"`

**Static Error Checking**

These errors should stop the program from compiling, _not_ happen at runtime.
You can continue to assume that all identifiers within a function body have
different names, which is a requirement for ANF (we could implement another pass
to rename variables, but we won't do that here). See the notes on `well_formed`
below for details on how to implement these static checks.

### Implementation

You shouldn't need any new assembly instructions to tackle this implementation.
You're free to add your own new instructions.

There are a few new pieces to the implementation:

1. Static Error Checking `lib/Language/Diamondback/Checker.hs`
2. ANF Conversion `lib/Language/Diamondback/Normalizer.hs`
3. Assembly Generation `lib/Language/Diamondback/Compiler.hs`
4. Tail call optimization `lib/Language/Diamondback/Compiler.hs`

#### 1. Static Error Checking

A set of `wellFormed` functions, defined in `Checker.hs`, which are called prior
to performing ANF and are used to report the errors above.

```haskell
wellFormed  :: BareProgram -> [UserError]
wellFormedD :: FunEnv -> BareDecl -> [UserError]
wellFormedE :: FunEnv -> Env -> Bare -> [UserError]
```

As before, `BareX` refers to the version of `X` (i.e. `Program`, `Decl` or
`Expr`) where the meta-data field is simply `SourceSpan`.

These functions all return a `[UserError]` -- i.e. a list of `UserError` that
represent **all the errors** in the respective program, declaration or
expression. So a program like

```python
def f(x, x):
  y

f(1)
```

would report **three errors**, one for `y` being unbound, one for duplicated `x`
parameters, and one for the arity mismatch on the call to `f`. To ensure that
the error-messages are sensible, feel free to use the supplied constructors --
e.g. `errUnboundVar`, `errDupParam` and `errCallArity`. Your task is to ensure
that you invoke the constructors with the correct parameters, found while
traversing the body of the program, declaration or expression, respectively.

These errors **can be reported in any order**; in general (and in grading), it's
easy to test for one at a time. Reporting many makes using the `main` of the
compiler much more pleasant, and is a nice view into the kinds of compiler
ergonomics we should expect from a modern compiler.

#### 2. ANF Conversion

You will have to extend the ANF conversion to account for function calls, by
filling in the definitions for:

```haskell
anf i (App f es l)      = error "TBD:anf:App"

imm i (App f es l)      = error "TBD:imm:App"
```

which convert a function call expression into **ANF** and **immediate** form,
respectively.

#### 3. Compiling Definitions and Calls

Your third major task is to implement the compilation of programs. When you are
done, you should be generating assembly that looks like:

```nasm
  ;; extern and global stuff
fun_decl1:
  ;; code for fun_decl1, including stack management
fun_decl2:
  ;; code for fun_decl2, including stack management
...
our_code_starts_here:
  ;; main entrypoint, as before, with stack management
internal_error_non_number:
  ;; errors, as before
...
```

To do so, complete the definitions of the functions below.

First, the `APgm`, `ADcl` and `AExp` types respectively contain ANF- and tagged-
versions of the top-level program, declaration and expressions. Fill in code to
generate `[Instruction]` for each of the above.

```haskell
-- lib/Language/Diamondback/Compiler.hs

compile :: APgm -> [Instruction]
compile (Prog ds e) = error "TBD:compile"

compileDecl :: ADcl -> [Instruction]
compileDecl (Decl f xs e l) = error "TBD:compileDecl"

compileEnv :: Env -> AExp -> [Instruction]
compileEnv env e = error "TBD:compileEnv"
```

Each function's `body` expression is compiled using `funInstrs n body` which
returns the instructions of `body` wrapped with code that sets up the stack (by
allocating space for n local vars) and restores the callees stack prior to
return.

```haskell
-- lib/Language/Diamondback/Compiler.hs

funInstrs :: Int -> [Instruction] -> [Instruction]
funInstrs n instrs
  = funEntry n
 ++ instrs
 ++ funExit
 ++ [IRet]
```

You will need to fill in the implementation of `funEntry` and `funExit` which
respectively generate the instructions for setting up stack for `n` local vars
and cleaning up stack prior to returning.

```haskell
-- lib/Language/Diamondback/Compiler.hs

funEntry :: Int -> [Instruction]
funEntry n = error "TBD:funEntry"

funExit :: [Instruction]
funExit = error "TBD:funExit"
```

Finally, fill in the definition of

```haskell
-- lib/Language/Diamondback/Asm.hs

dynError   :: DynError -> [Instruction]
dynError e = error "TBD:dynError"
```

to contain the labels and code for handling the three different kinds of
run-time errors, namely type-errors and arithmetic overflow.

#### 4. Tail call optimization

Last step is to refine your compilation of function applications to support
tail-calls. Specifically the recursive call at the tail position inside a
function is optimized to a `jmp`, instead of a `call`. This task involves two
steps:

1. Figuring out which function calls are amenable to the tail-call optimization.
   This is already implemented for you by the new `tails` compiler pass (in
   `lib/Language/Diamondback/Label.hs`). You can use the `annTail` helper
   function to check whether it is ok to apply the optimization when compiling
   an `App` expression.
2. Applying the optimization itself. This involves the steps explained below.

To implement this optimization, rather than pushing the next set of arguments
onto the stack, we simply move them into the existing stack slots at `EBP + 8`,
`EBP + 12`, `EBP + 16`, etc. Once all the arguments to the function is replaced,
we need to re-enter our existing function, but we can’t use `call` to do it.

The meaning of `call` is to push a return address onto the stack and `jmp` to
the destination address. But

1. We already have the necessary return address sitting on the stack!
2. We also have a saved EBP on the stack too! 

This means that the `funEntry` we normally execute isn’t really needed here. So
instead, we’ll simply `jmp` directly to the next instruction in our code, and
re-use the same stack frame.

## Interactive REPL 

```bash
$ make ghci
```

and then you are inside `ghci` where you can use the function `run` to
**rapidly** test your code.

```haskell
run :: FilePath -> Program -> IO Result

data Program = File       -- program code is inside an input file
             | Code Text  -- program code is given in Text
```

The first argument is the input file (i.e. inside `tests/input`), and the second
argument is either `Code Text` or `File`. For example to directly compile and
run a string do:

```haskell
run "test" (Code "1 + 2") 
```

To run a program whose code is in a file `tests/input/file.diamond` do:

```haskell
run "file" File
```

Of course, neither works now. When you edit your code, instead of having to
rebuild, you can more rapidly type `:reload` in `ghci` and then re-run the above
commands.


## Valgrind 

If you wish, use `valgrind` (installed in the lab) to help debug your code, for
example thus:

```
$ make tests/output/five.vresult 
```

or in `ghci` as:

```
λ> vrun "test" (Code "1 + 2") 
λ> vrun "file" File
```

## Crafting Good Tests (Extra Credit)

As in the last assignment, we are going to use the tests from your
`tests/yourTests.json` file to check whether you were able to break any of our N
buggy implementations, which we call "mutations". The goal here is to write good
test cases that will catch as many types of bugs as possible.

## Submission Instructions
